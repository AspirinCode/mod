Class ``DG``
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. py:class:: DG

    The main derivation graph class. A derivation graph is a directed hypergraph :math:`H = (V, E)`.
    Each vertex is annotated with a graph, and each hyperedge is annotated with a transformation rule.
    A derivation graph can either be calculated from a strategy or loaded from external data.

    .. py:attribute:: id

        The unique instance id among all :class:`DG` objects.

        :type: int
    .. py:attribute:: numVertices

        (Read-only) The number of vertices in the derivation graph.

        :type: int
    .. py:attribute:: vertices

        (Read-only) An iterable of all vertices in the derivation graph.

        :type: :py:class:`DGVertexRange`
    .. py:attribute:: numEdges

        (Read-only) The number of hyperedges in the derivation graph.

        :type: int
    .. py:attribute:: edges

        (Read-only) An iterable of all hyperedges in the derivation graph.

        :type: :py:class:`DGEdgeRange`
    .. py:method:: findVertex(g)

        :param g: the graph to find a vertex which has it associated.
        :type g: :class:`Graph`
        :returns: a vertex descriptor for which the given graph is associated,
            or a null descriptor if no such vertex exists.
        :rtype: :class:`DGVertex`
    .. py:method:: findEdge(sources, targets)
                   findEdge(sourceGraphs, targetGraphs)

        :param sources: the list of source vertices the resulting hyperedge must have.
        :type sources: list of :class:`Vertex`
        :param targets: the list of targets vertices the resulting hyperedge must have.
        :type targets: list of :class:`Vertex`
        :param sourceGraphs: the list of graphs that must be associated with the source vertices the resulting hyperedge must have.
        :type sourceGraphs: list of :class:`Graph`
        :param targetGraphs: the list of graphs that must be associated with the targets vertices the resulting hyperedge must have.
        :type targetGraphs: list of :class:`Graph`
        :returns: a hyperedge with the given sources and targets.
          If no such hyperedge exists in the derivation graph then a null edge is returned.
          In the second version, the graphs are put through :meth:`findVertex` first.
        :raises: :class:`LogicError` if a vertex descriptor is null, or does not belong to the derivation graph.
    .. py:method:: calc()

        Create the actual derivation graph.
    .. py:attribute:: graphDatabase

        All graphs known to the derivation graph.

        :type: list of :class:`Graph`
    .. py:attribute:: products

        The subset of the vertex graphs which were discovered by the calculation.

        :type: list of :class:`Graph`
    .. py:method:: print(printer=DGPrinter(), data=None)

        Print the derivation graph in style of a hypergraph. The appearance and structure
        of the visualisation can optionally be configured by giving a DG printer and/or data object.

        :param printer: the printer to use governing the appearance.
        :type printer: :class:`DGPrinter`
        :param data: the extra data to use encoding the structure of the graph.
        :type data: :class:`DGPrintData`
    .. py:method:: dump()

        Export the derivation graph to an external file. The vertex graphs are exported as well.

        :returns: the filename of the exported derivation graph.
        :rtype: string
    .. py:method:: list()

        List information about the calculation.
    .. py:method:: listStats()

        Lists various statistics for the derivation graph.
.. py:method:: dgDerivations(ders)

    :param ders: the list of derivations to include in the derivation graph.
    :type ders: list of :class:`Derivation`
    :returns: a derivation graph from a list of :class:`Derivation`.
    :rtype: :class:`DG`
.. py:method:: dgAbstract(s)

    :param s: the abstract specification of a derivation graph.
    :type s: string
    :returns: Construct a derivation graph from an abstract set of derivations. See :cpp:func:`DG::abstract` for the specification format.
    :rtype: :class:`DG`
.. py:method:: dgRuleComp(graphs, strat)

    Initialize a derivation graph defined by a strategy.

    :param graphs: an initial graph database. Any derived graph isomorphic to one of these graphs will be replaced by the given graph.
    :type graphs: list of :class:`Graph`
    :param strat: the strategy which will be used for calculating the actual derivation graph.
    :type strat: :class:`DGStrat`
    :returns: the derivation graph object. The calculation method must be called to create the actual derivation graph.
    :rtype: :class:`DG`
.. py:method:: dgDump(graphs, rules, file)

    Load a derivation graph dump.

    :param graphs: Any graph in the dump which is isomorphic one of these graphs is replaced by the given graph.
    :type graphs: list of :class:`Graph`
    :param rules: As for the graphs the same procedure is done for the rules, however only using the name of the rule for comparison.
    :type rules: list of :class:`Rule`
    :returns: the loaded derivation graph.
    :rtype: :class:`DG`
.. py:method:: diffDGs(dg1, dg2)

    Compare two derivation graphs and lists the difference.
    This is not a general isomorphism check; two vertices are equal if they have
    the same graph attached. Edges are equal if the head and tail sets are equal
    and if the attached rule is the same.

    :param dg1: the first derivation graph.
    :type dg1: :class:`DG`
    :param dg2: the second derivation graph.
    :type dg2: :class:`DG`

Class ``DerivationRef``

.. py:class:: DerivationRef

    A reference to a derivation in a specific derivation graph, or an invalid reference.
    
    .. py:attribute:: id

        (Read-only) If the reference is valid, this is the id of the pointed to derivation.

        :type: unsigned int
    .. py:attribute:: dg

        (Read-only) If the reference is valid, this is the derivation graph the reference points into.

        :type: :class:`DG`
    .. py:method:: isValid()

        :returns: whether or not the reference is valid.
        :rtype: bool
    .. py:attribute:: derivation

        (Read-only) If the reference is valid, this is the pointed to derivation.

        :type: :class:`Derivation`
    .. py:method:: print(printer=GraphPrinter(), matchColour="ForestGreen")

        Print the derivation pointed to by the derivation reference.
        All possible Double-Pushout diagrams for the derivation are printed.

        :param printer: the printer to use for the figures.
        :type printer: :class:`GraphPrinter`
        :param matchColour: the TikZ colour to use for the rule and its image in the bottom span.
